# Catherine the Great Timeline
My very first coding project - a tribute page to Catherine the Great.

## Description

This project was created with the simple purpose of letting me practice some basic HTML and CSS. If you happen to learn an interesting fact or two about Catherine the Great's life while reading it, then even better!
